			<h1>About Olivia.</h1>
			<p class="about-intro">Graduating from a four-year university with a bachelor degree in design has provided me with the fundamental of theoretical knowledge, and technical skills.<br><br>Some skills include photo and video editing, business
				branding, 3D modeling, and web designing. These varieties of skills have given me the flexibility to work in different environments, and shaped my perspective towards the field of design. <br><br>I believe a designer does more than the iterative
				work of beautifying and perfecting the world. Being a witness of how design has changed and shaped our society on a daily basis, I am driven by the power and the ultimate possibilities design can offer, and decided to pursue my dream into
				becoming a designer who uses visuals and graphic techniques as the methodology to solve problems in real life.</p>
