      <h2>4 Factors Driving the Present and Future of Knowledge Sharing</h2>

      <h4>1. DEEP INDEXING FOR OPTIMAL SEARCH CAPABILITIES</h4>
      <p>The biggest factor driving the development of knowledge sharing is search. The ability to type in a couple keywords and receive relevant results makes it easy to find not just a specific piece of content, but other similar, related content,
        too. While this is great for written documents, technology now exists that allows a deep search within videos and PDFs, making search even more powerful.</p>

      <h4>2. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MORE PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCES</h4>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is driving the next wave of personalization enhancements to knowledge sharing platforms. AI can be used to establish contextual similarities between documents and to serve users relevant content suggestions. AI also
        combs through uploaded content to identify relevant tags and then pin those tags to content, making documents 50% more findable. Bloomfire COO Mark Hammer believes that the future of knowledge sharing platforms is incumbent on the continued
        integration of artificial intelligence. Without AI, database content loses context. Not only does such technology make content more searchable, but it can also be programmed to push relevant content to the appropriate people at the right
        time. To do so, search engines will need AI engines that personalize information based on interests and recognizable patterns. Through a combination of ranking algorithms and identifying contextually similar content, AI addresses a wide
        variety of applications.</p>

      <h4>3. COLLABORATIVE CAPABILITIES PROVIDING CONTEXT FOR CONTENT</h4>
      <p>Interacting with, rather than simply viewing, content provides context and helps deepen understanding. When users can interact with content by writing comments, posing questions, and “liking” documents, technology can spur collaboration.
        “My ability to see what questions are being posted on the platform, and the comments and follows to the content, has greatly enhanced my ability to see what’s going on in the organization,” said Hammer. “Seeing the content posted is one
        thing, but Bloomfire gives me that ability to see our walls being knocked down. I ask myself, are there things not being addressed? Why not, and who’s responsible? Do we have a gap in coverage?”</p>

      <h4>4. CUSTOMER CENTRICITY REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE SHARING</h4>
      <p>Understanding your customers is one of the most valuable investments a business can make. However, it’s the actions and strategies impacted that really make the investment worthwhile. Yet organizations often run into obstacles when managing
        and sharing research, diminishing its impact. According to Forrester, only 49% of business decisions are made using qualitative data, as opposed to opinions or gut feelings. Often departmental or technological silos exist between business
        units that prevent information from flowing between the knowledge holders, in most cases the insights team, to the business leaders, marketers, innovation teams, brand teams, and others who need it. Knowledge sharing platforms provide a
        simple way for others to access high-level details from reports, leading to knowledgeable decisions on what actions in specific markets would prove beneficial.</p>
