      <h2>The Beginning of Knowledge Sharing</h2>
      <p>One of the earliest known iterations of knowledge sharing took the form of cave drawings in 15,000 BC. From there, documentation became more sophisticated, evolving from imagery to alphabets, and from walls to scrolls. Monks and academics
        took on the role of transcribing books and organizing encyclopedias, storing knowledge away in exclusive libraries. The invention of the printing press in 1440 was the first time information was easily distributed via print material. It
        wasnâ€™t until over 400 years later that libraries were available to the general public.

      <h2>Sharing Information in the 20th Century</h2>
      <p>The 1900s saw incredibly rapid changes in knowledge sharing, starting with real-time radio broadcasting at the beginning of the century and then culminating with the invention of the internet in the 1980s. As information grew more and more
        accessible, it was harder to imagine functioning without the technologies enabling this new level of connectivity. It quickly became clear that a means for managing this excess, albeit incredibly useful, information was greatly
        needed.Research shows that consultants were amongst the first professionals to seriously explore and consider the best means of sharing knowledge. Some consulting companies relied on key players to manage and share knowledge via
        person-to-person interactions, whereas other organizations turned to computers to codify and store information in databases. Using computers allowed them to communicate knowledge rather than simply store it. As companies grew and technology
        improved, one lesson had been made clear: the death of knowledge is to isolate it.

      <h2>The Current State</h2>
      <p>Today, many businesses are still figuring out the best solutions for managing knowledge to leverage its full potential. A number of free and paid applications and platforms exist to store and share knowledge, some focusing on specific types
        of knowledge (i.e. password vaults and photo libraries) and others maintaining more broad applications (i.e. Dropbox and Evernote). While there are countless platforms to store and share knowledge, finding ones that are highly searchable is
        rare. Without the ability to easily search, knowledge inevitably gets lost. Duplicate content is eventually created, and often produces a lack of consistency amongst the stored data. What is presented as a solution for clutter often proves
        oversimplified.
